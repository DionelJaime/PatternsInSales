# Projection Description
#Project Description
We aim to analyze multi-year sales data from a large retailer to uncover key insights into product
performance, seasonal and geographic trends, and market dynamics. This project primarily will
explore relations between various sales metrics and identify factors influencing product profitability
through the use unsupervised learning methods for data exploration and visualisation to derive key
market insights. Furthermore, we will develop supervised learning models to predict product demand
based on past sales data. We also intend to investigate the potential for connecting manufacturers
with consumers across different markets, enhancing retail effectiveness and maximizing profits. By
assessing the quality of goods alongside consumer preferences, we aim to create a robust framework
for linking desired products with their producers, ultimately benefiting retailers, consumers, and
manufacturers alike.
# Stakeholders
1. Large retailers can gain insights into sales trends, seasonal patterns, and product pairings,
helping them optimize inventory, marketing, and pricing strategies to boost profits.
2. Advertisers can gain insights into seasonal and geographical trends, enabling them to generate
targeted advertisement tactics to further boost revenue.
3. Shareholders can use this information to develop investment strategies, timing their decisions
based on seasonal performance and market trends.

# KPIs
• Product-Specific Profit Growth Rate: Measures the percentage increase or decrease in
profit for individual products over a specified period (e.g., monthly or weekly).
• Overall Profit Growth Rate: Tracks the overall change in profit for the entire product
portfolio over time.
• Product-Specific Sales Growth Rate: Evaluates the increase or decrease in sales volume
for specific products over time.
• Overall Sales Growth Rate: Measures the total increase in sales across all products over
time.

# Dataset
The data contains 51,291 rows and 21 columns with information related to geography, product
categories, sales, profits, and consumer data. Each row contains the details of an order for an online
superstore. The date of the orders range from 1/1/2012 to 9/9/2014
